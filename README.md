# Modern-Warfare-Warzone-Cheat
#### A cheat for modern warfare (the warzone) game mode. Threw it together in a day and put 0 effort into it so expect shit code. Nonetheless it works

**THIS IS NOT UPDATED NOR WILL I UPDATE IT FOR YOU**

### Creaing a thread in the dll is not safe
 - Remove that and add the code relying on that thread (the key loop) into one of the hooked functions

- Top right a small terrible  menu
- Top left a terrible watermark

## Keybinds (numpad)
  - 0 brings up debug console
  - 1 toggles esp
  - 2 toggles text
  - 3 toggles snaplines
  
When the enemy gets closer than 100m their color turns to orange
Dll needs to be natively injected (no manual map thred hijack etc, if u want security then fix that)
